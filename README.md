# excel_utils

### This is the start of a project that hopes to do the following:
1. create a simple interface for updating a routine report in Excel
2. allow the user to chain a relatively small number of commands in various ways for routine updates of an Excel report
3. automatically builds a reusable record (a `cosmo_macro`) while stepping through the workflow
4. ability to save the `cosmo_macro` and reload later to run again
5. create a log tracking every change allowing the user to remove bad changes or overwrite them with new ones later

Basically I want to remove most of my day-to-day drugery from my active attention while still creating reports as they are expected from management. 

Not trying to change anything on their end, just trying to make it simpler for me.
